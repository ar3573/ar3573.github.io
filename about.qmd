Hi, I'm **Aryan Lokagariwar** — a Business Analytics student who loves turning messy data into sharp decisions.  
I’ve worked across:

- **Scalable analytics** with **PySpark** (SQL/DataFrames, MLlib) on AWS EC2  
- **Decision support** & simulation (optimization, sensitivity analysis)  
- **Storytelling for impact** — clear visuals, concise narratives, and executive summaries  

---

### Focus Areas

- **Predictive & Prescriptive Analytics:** regression & classification at scale; linear and integer optimization for allocation and pricing  
- **ETL & Data Modeling:** schema design, partitioning, and performance tuning  
- **Visualization:** Plotly, Quarto, Power BI; dashboard design principles  

---

### Tools

`Python` · `PySpark` · `Pandas` · `SQL` · `AWS EC2` · `Git/GitHub` · `Power BI` · `Quarto`

---

### Currently

- Advancing **Spark ML** workflows and reproducible, Quarto-based reporting.  
- Delivering a simulation-driven **Managerial Report** (multi-part) on an in-house microbrewery business case (AD715).  

> I’m actively seeking roles in **data science / analytics** (risk, pricing, operations, ML) where I can ship reliable insights at scale.
